Queue is a first in first out data structure. Reomoval from the head of the queue and insertion at the tail.
A process is a program in action. A program counter is an index in code which tells where the program is executing right now. Stack is used by a process to pass arguments and return values. When a process takes a snapshot, it captures the current status of the program counter, the contents in the stack and the heap.

CLoud = Lot of storage + compute cycles nearby

FOur characterstics of cloud: 
a. Massive Scale
b. On demand acess : Pay as you go
c. Data intensive nature
d. New Cloud Programming paradigms. - Process the data - MapReduce, Storage paradigms - NoSQL and Key value store.

Cloud is a distributed systems which follows a client-server architecture to distribute services. Operating systems manages the different components and services of a device.

OS functionality
a.  Manages the hardware using device drivers.
b. Provides abstractions for file management and process management.
c. Resource Manager

A distributed system is a collection of entites each of which are programmable, autonomous, asynchronous and failure prone which communicate over an unreliable communication medium.
  It is different from parallel systems where the clocks of the systems are synchromized.
Many processes sending and recieving messages through the unreliable medium in a distributed system.

Challenges that we might face while designing a distributed system
a. Scalability
b. Failures: failure are a norm not an exception
c.Asynchroncy
d. COncurrency

Map Reduce: Map is a meta function that applies any operation to a list of elements.
Reduce is a meta function that process group of records in batch.

Map process individual enities into intermedidate key-value pairs. The records are processed independently of each other. One map task runs through the records sequentially.

The reduce process and merges the key value pair from the map task on a per key basis. Reduce phase cannot process the records independently. We want the values belonging to one key to appear at the same reducer so that they can get merged.
  The partioning of keys to reducers can be done with many methods
  a. Hash partioning:  Hash the key. Modulo of number of reduce servers. That will give the number to where to send the key
