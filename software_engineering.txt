Software process
a,. Waterfall model : Rigid steps
b. Evolutionary prototyping
c. UML
d. Agile methodology

Phases
Requirement engineering : What kind of system we want to build.
Design: High levl structure of our system
Implementation: Writing code
Verification and validation
Maintaince

Verification - Did we build the system right
Validation - Did we build the right system. It can be performed at different levels
  * Unit level - Did individual units work as expected
  * Integration level - Did interaction between units work
  * System - All the system works well.

Maintaince: a. Bug report - Correctice maintaince
b. Feature request - perfective --!!---
c. New system and libraries - Adaptive --""--

  Regression testing is done after each software modification to check if the new changes introduced any bugs in the system.
Software lifecycle model is a presecrtive way of telling how to do stuff from start to end.
