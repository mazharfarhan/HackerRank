JSP is the java's EE web programming language. Java Server Pages is used for creating dynamic web applications. It bridges the gap between
html and java codes with additional featueres like expressions, servlet tags and others.

Both the JSP and JSF have similar syntax for expressions where the only difference is that JSP uses $ symbol where as JSF uses #. In JSF, as we know we use the class name with the small first letter. Unless their is an explicit name defined in the name annotation.

The expression language example
  <h: panelGroup rendered="#{not empty track.cargo}"  # track is the class name
  The above syntax is checking if the value cargo is not empty based on which it will render the view with the component.
  
 Use of implicit HTTP request object
    <a href= "#{request.contextPath}"

In modern Java EE, annotations has replaced xml files, convention over configuration has replaced tedious manual configurations and dependency injection hides resource creation and look up. We just need a POJO(plain old java object) with annotations to have a EJB

EJB encapsulates the business logic. The container provides various EJB services like thread safety, mointoring and transaction, pooling.
Two types of Enterprise java beans : 
a. Session beans
b. Message driven beans

Session beans implement business logic, They are going to be stateful, stateless or singleton. They also hold specific client related data.

There is only one type pof workflow bean - message driven bean. They cannot be directly accessed by the client. The only way to communicate with them is through messages.

Access modes of EJB's

a. Local (default): Within the container.
b. Remote : External application
c. Web Service: client using web serice protocol.

Management modes: 
a.Container access: Convention over configuration.
b. Bean access itself: Developers with the help service annotations.
